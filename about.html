            <h3><b>What is Reiki?</b></h3>
          <p>The awareness of an unseen energy flowing through all living things and directly affecting the quality of a person’s health has been part of the wisdom of many cultures since ancient times. This life energy goes by many names: Qi in China, Ki in Japan, and Prana in India. The ancient Hawaiians call it Ti or Ki. It has also been called orgone energy and élan vital, and science refers to it as biofield energy.</p>
          <p>When life energy is low, it is more difficult to deal with stress; one may not sleep well and may become more susceptible to illness. When life energy is strong, one feels strong and can more easily deal with stress and are less likely to become ill. Reiki is a technique for increasing a one’s supply of life energy.</p>

            <h3><b>History of Reiki</b></h3>
          <p>Reiki was developed by Mikao Usui in 1922. Usui was born August 15, 1865 in Taniai Village, Yamagata District, Cifu Prefecture. At an early age, Usui entered a Tendai Buddhist school near Mr. Kurama. Usui was known for his gentle character, honest and candid mannerisms. He enjoyed learning, reading and exploring a variety of topics including, medical science, religion, divination, history, and psychology. Usui traveled to Europe, America and studied in China. Usui also studied Kiko, the Japanese version of Qi-gong. Usui noted the healing techniques were depleting the energies of the practitioners. He wondered if it was possible to heal without using the energy of the practitioner.</p>
                
          <p>Eventually, Usui became the Secretary to Shinpei Goto, Head of the Department of Health and Welfare, who later became the Mayor of Tokyo. Usui was also a member of the Rei Jyutu Ka, a group dedicated to developing psychic abilities. March 1922, Usui was having difficulties in his business and personal life and enrolled in Isyu Guo, as 21-day training course, sponsored by the Tendai Buddhist Temple, located near Mt. Kurama. People would stand under a small waterfall on the mountain to meditate. This practice is believed to activate the Crown Chakra. Japanese Reiki Masters believe Usui may have used this meditation as part of his practice. It was during the Isyu Guo training when Reiki energy entered Usui’s Crown Chakra. He became aware of his ability to use this unseen energy to heal himself and others with immediate results. Dr. Usui passed his knowledge onto Dr. Chujiro, who taught Mrs. Hawayo Takata, who eventually brought Reiki to the rest of the world.</p>

            <h3><b>What to expect at an In-Person Session</b></h3>
          <p>A traditional Reiki session proceeds with the recipient remaining fully clothed and relaxed, either lying on a treatment table or sitting in a comfortably supported chair.</p>
          <p>The practitioner conducts the Reiki session through light, non-invasive touch with the practitioner’s hands placed and held on a series of locations on the head, front and back of the torso. The placement of the hands should never be intrusive or inappropriate, nor should there be any pressure.</p>
            
          <p>Additional placements on the limbs can be done as needed (example: if there is an injury or surgical scar), and some practitioners routinely perform.</p>
            
          <p>The Reiki practitioner can hold their hands just off the body if needed (example: the presence of an open wound or burn), or if the recipient prefers. </p>
            
          <p>A brief discussion time is usually included in an In-Person session.</p>
